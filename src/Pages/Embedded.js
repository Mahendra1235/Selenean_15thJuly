            We build embedded and IoT products that bridge the physical and
            digital worlds — from sensor to cloud. Our engineering teams
            prototype, validate, and productize embedded solutions across
            industries, with a strong focus on edge intelligence, real-time data
            capture, and scalable connectivity. Every solution is built to move
            from proof-of-concept to field deployment with minimal friction.
